# introduction
Hello, my name is Julie Cheng. I am currently a Flatiron School, flexible online bootcamp student in the software engineering program with an expected graduation in May. I have been a pharmacist for 10 years and am pursuing a career change. I have no experience with Java but I am excited to get the opportunity to learn and experience it.
